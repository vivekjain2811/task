# Job readiness for graduates 

##   Problem 
India has a lot of engineering students with degrees, but little practical skills. The reason lie in 
- Education system. After 10, competitive exams. University focus is on academics, with little to no ties with the industry. 
- The Software Industry moves faster than other industries. Especially academic programs. e.g . It will be impossible for universities to get a course on llm before 2027. Because they won’t have professors with the same experience. etc 
- In the knowledge economy, books and other resources are in public domain. University restricts the students rather than pushes them forwards. 
- Poor salary pay  for teachers. Diluted quality of engineering institutions. Politicians owning most of the engineering institutions. 
- In summary, educational institutions are slow to react to market changes. Model is based on the mass education factory model with no personalization. In this era of AI and software revolution, a personalized software based approach can deliver better results.

## Distribution 
Students all over India are required to do 1 year of internship at a company. This provides students an incentive to step out of the classroom and collaborate with the industry. Unfortunately, many companies are taking advantage of this by hiring students from computer science departments to do manual data entry work.

It’s easy to get students. With very little effort in advertising, we were able to get 350 students. With more effort, we can get more than 1000 students easily. 


## Why will we win ?
- Industry experience. 
- Little to no competition. No one spends so much time building polished product for students. Hackerrank started with that, but their product has stagnated, as they have started to focus on enterprise. Other platforms are focussed on DSA. 
- One distinguishing point may be that we focus on wholesome software engineering rather than focussing on grinding leetcode 
- AI will make a lot of task easier to scale. E.g personalized review of answers can be done with the help of AI and community review. 
- A lot of tasks can be offloaded to community such 
- Troubleshooting and coding help: students will accumulate points if their answers get selected like quora. 
- Reviewing assignments: Qualified/graduated students can review their junior’s assignments. 
- Free for students. Students can’t afford to pay for this service. So, we work on making it cheaper to operate. That requires innovation in technology.

## Products
We start with offering internships. But, later we can add more incremental products around that user base. 
 
- Internships 
- Resume builder
- Hackathon for students to build something.
- Reddit/discord style community for knowledge sharing. 
- Job board for students to apply to jobs.
- Data  annotation product with students 
- A solid user base to try out products 
- Sell higher level courses down the line, once they start working in corporate. 
- Incubator for startup ideas.
- B2B sales to influencers looking to launch their own course. (https://academy.dhruvrathee.com/home )
- Mentoring platform like https://mentorcruise.com/ or https://topmate.io/ 
Community/discussion threads like https://www.grapevine.in/home 


## Revenue 
We don’t charge students for the internship program. But, We need to generate revenue to keep operations going. Few ways to generate revenue. 
- Charge Colleges to conduct workshops/Hackathons in the college campus. 
- Offer ancillary products for a fee. 
- Sell LMS as a service to businesses/influencers/businesses.
- Grant from the government / iStart rajasthan.
