# Thoughts and opinions 
This is my page. I will write some thought, observation and recomendations here to share with the team.

## Ruby on rails 
An experienced rails developer one can do a task in 2 days, what other framework will do in one week. However, rails (as well as ruby) has a very steep learning curve making it very hard for beginners to approach. 

## Postgresql
Postgresql is one of the oldest open-source software projects, older than the linux itself. It is also the most feature rich database in the market, (maybe second only to oracle db). You could use it as a queue, caching database, object store, vector store etc. the list goes on. Morever, one could develop their own extensions to modify the database as they wish. All this makes it very useful tool for any developer. 

## Sqlite 
This is "database in a pocket". It can be installed as a standalone binary of less than 1 MB. You would think that because of its small size, it would have comprised on sql features, but taht's not simply true. It support most of the sql features, you would expect from a database. Moreover, whole database somes in a single file. 

## Rust 
Rust gives you performance of the C/C++, without the memory leak dangers of C/C++. Makes it an ideal choice for writing optimized softwares. Recently, some of the node and python ecossytem tools have been re-written in the Rust and they are gaing tractions. e.g. Deno, ruff, pola.rs, uv, pixi etc. More and more high impact libraries will be written in Rust. 

## Public cloud is expensive 
Cost of hosting on AWS is 4 times higher than hetzner. A server with 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, 16 vcpu costs 
- 12 k inr per month on AWS 
- 7k INR per month on utho 
- 3k inr per month on hetzner 

Also, serverbasket.com offer the same box for 3k inr per month. Plus, they also sell hardware that you can use in your own server room. 

So, we will see companies moving from public cloud provider to Kubernetes cluster running on multi-cloud. Also, indian players will come to market very soon. 

## Decentralization of tech platforms 

Business are now owning the distribution and sale channel, rather than just being a spectator on the platform. We see this trend in 
- Amazon -> Shopify, Shopdeck
- Uber -> Namma Yatri 
- Swiggy -> ONDC 
- Medium -> blog websites 

## India will build its own big tech 

Currently, there tech infra used in India is all owned by US. Soon, we will have our 
- Own search engine 
- own social media 
- own messaging app 
- own cloud provider 
- own desktop/mobile Operating system 
- own smartphone maker 


## Coding assistants are crutches for junior developers
Junior developers should focuss on learning the fundamentals of technology rather than taking the shortcut and ask copilot for help. Struggle and sufferings are the way to mastery of a particular domain.
