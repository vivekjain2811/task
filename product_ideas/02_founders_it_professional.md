# Community for Founders and IIT professionals 

## Problem 
There are many whatsapp groups where these high profile(10-40 yoe, CXO, VCs, policy makers) folks post their requirements and updates. This network is very passive and unstructured. 
- People post requirements, and itâ€™s only visible for a day or two. Then, it gets buried in the feed. 
- I have access to phone numbers of these high-impact individuals, but there is very little value I can derive at the moment. 
- There are CXOs switching jobs, looking for help, hiring talent. This is all very fragmented and not organized. 


## Distribution
We have access to  20+ high quality whatsapp group of c suite professionals, who will be more than willing to help us in our journey. These people can also help us by introducing to the other groups and make other connections. 

## Why will we win ?
Good distribution, faster feedback cycle, cheap development cost.

## Products 
We will need to build a database of these contacts. Name, phone, email, linkedin, past interests and chats. This will be stored in the database in a structured way. 

- **Internal search and dashboard**: We use the data for ourselves to reach out to specialists in certain skills, industry, government, or a position of power. This is a goldmine, because we have more than 50% response rate on these leads. There are warm leads, not cold. E.g. 
  - Anyone in the government working in the finance ministry ?
  - Anyone who has built a travel startup  before?
  - Anyone who has experience in the L&D domain ?
  - Anyone who has scaled a startup from 1 cr to 100 cr ?
  - Anyone who can help us with BD in Indonesia ?
- **Mentorship/consultation platform**: We will build a profile for each of these people. Integrate payments system and offer sessions to anyone looking to connect. 
- **Offer this rich high-quality data to headhunters/HRs**: Recruiters focusing on filling CXO roles, can leverage this data for theri search.
